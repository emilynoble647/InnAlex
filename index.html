                After spending a few years travelling the world, we have come to realise that the Sunshine Coast has one
                of the best climates in the world and Alexandra Headland has its own micro-climate.
                Our hot days usually have northerly winds. Here on Alex's North facing Headland, these northerly winds
                blow straight off the ocean and keep our temperatures down.
                When the strong south easterlies are blowing we are protected from these by Mooloolaba and our Headland
                and we just get the lower temperatures. With our sub tropical climate it is hard to beat for good
                weather.</p>
